How To - Create a New Ecosystem
======================================================================

An ecosystem is a single GitHub organization that curates
a collection of packages for maintenance given its topic.
This can be for an entire programming language like
maintaining important Go packages or as niche as web
frameworks such as React UIs.

Get Started - Applying for an Ecosystem
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming you're using the production website or, if developing locally,
have created a GitHub app and use your own GitHub account as the GitHub Owner
account, to begin applying:

1. Create a new GitHub organization
2. In GitHub Marketplace, `install the "Ur OSS World" GitHub app`_
   into your organization. Allow all scopes and continue.

.. _install the "Ur OSS World" GitHub app: https://github.com/apps/ur-oss-world

3. Ensure the GitHub owner (e.g. UrOSSWorldOwner) is added as an owner
   to the organization. If not, then change the role to be "Owner".
4. Leave the organization. If there are other owners in the organization,
   have them also leave. You will be given ownership back in a later step.
   This way, complete and total ownership is given to Ur OSS World's Owner
   GitHub account for security purposes.

.. warning::
   This will be checked during the application process in the following steps.

.. note::
   The purpose of this step is to transfer ownership of the entire GitHub
   organization to this GitHub user account for security purposes. We trust
   that you have good intentions, but, sometimes, unforeseen circumstances
   happen that require that Ur OSS World has total ownership to intervene
   in any incident.

   Not all types of incidents are bad! For example, there is a possibility that
   the original owner is no longer active which requires transferring ownership
   or the organization may want to leave Ur OSS World. For these reasons, having
   complete ownership would make our lives easier!

   Thank you for understanding :)

5. Go to https://theur.world/accounts/login/ and login/signup via GitHub.
6. Go to https://theur.world/ecosystem/apply/ and fill it the necessary
   information.
7. Allow for us to process your application in 3-5 business days.
   We'll send you any follow-up information in an email.

.. note::
   Sorry! We promise we'll figure out how to make administration faster!
